The AI assistant's performance on these math problems is poor (20.25% accuracy). The primary reasons for failure are:

1.  **Incorrect Tool Call Generation:** The assistant frequently fails to structure the API call to the `calculate` tool correctly according to its required nested JSON schema, especially for multi-step calculations. It also attempts unsupported actions like simultaneous calls or placeholder references.
2.  **Misinterpretation of Prompt Logic:** The assistant often struggles to translate the natural language math problem into the correct sequence and nesting of operations (respecting order of operations) for the tool call. This leads to the tool calculating the wrong expression.
3.  **Inability to Chain Operations:** The tool and/or the assistant's usage pattern doesn't effectively support chaining multiple dependent calculations (e.g., "take the result of A, then multiply by B"). The attempts to use placeholders or multiple calls fail.
4.  **Manual Calculation Errors:** When the AI attempts to explain or perform steps manually in its response text, it sometimes makes calculation errors.

The assistant performs reasonably well on simple, single-operation problems where the tool call structure is straightforward (e.g., "A multiplied by B"). However, its ability to handle complexity involving multiple operations, order of operations, or nested calculations is severely lacking due to fundamental issues in generating correct, sequential, or nested tool calls based on the prompt.
